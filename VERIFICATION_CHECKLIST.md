## Deployment Verification

### Environment Setup
- [ ] .env file configured on server
- [ ] TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN set
- [ ] ENABLE_SIMPLE_BOT=true
- [ ] TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL set (HTTPS)
- [ ] TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_PATH set (optional)
- [ ] ENABLE_REMINDER_CRON set (optional)

### Server Deployment
- [ ] Code deployed to server
- [ ] npm install run
- [ ] Server can start without errors
- [ ] Webhook endpoint accessible via HTTPS

### Bot Verification
- [ ] Run: npm run test:webhook
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Bot initializes successfully
- [ ] Webhook methods available

### Server Start Verification
- [ ] Start server: npm start
- [ ] Check logs for:
  - [ ] "âœ… Simple Telegram Bot initialized"
  - [ ] "ðŸ”— Setting up webhook at /api/telegram/webhook"
  - [ ] "âœ… Webhook configured"
  - [ ] "âœ… Simple Telegram Bot started in WEBHOOK mode"
  - [ ] "âœ… ReminderService initialized"
  - [ ] "âœ… Reminder cron jobs started successfully"

### Webhook Verification
- [ ] Webhook URL registered with Telegram
- [ ] Check webhook info:
  ```bash
  curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo
  ```
- [ ] Verify response shows:
  - [ ] url: your webhook URL
  - [ ] has_custom_certificate: false
  - [ ] pending_update_count: 0 (or low)
  - [ ] last_error_message: empty

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Send /start to bot
- [ ] Bot responds with welcome message
- [ ] Send /help to bot
- [ ] Bot responds with help message
- [ ] Send text message
- [ ] Bot responds appropriately

### ReminderService Testing
- [ ] Check logs for cron job initialization
- [ ] Verify cron jobs are scheduled
- [ ] Wait for next scheduled time or trigger manually
- [ ] Verify reminders are sent

### Server Health
- [ ] Access health endpoint: /api/reader/health
- [ ] Server responds with 200 OK
- [ ] All services report healthy

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Monitor server CPU/memory usage
- [ ] Check for webhook request processing
- [ ] Verify no polling is occurring
- [ ] Check response times

## Post-Deployment Checks

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up logging for webhook endpoint
- [ ] Monitor webhook request count
- [ ] Track bot update processing
- [ ] Monitor ReminderService execution

### Cleanup
- [ ] Stop old bot/start.js process (if running)
- [ ] Verify no duplicate bot processes
- [ ] Remove old polling configurations
- [ ] Clean up old logs

### Documentation
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Update team about webhook mode
- [ ] Share WEBHOOK_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Document any environment-specific settings

### Backup Plan
- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Test deleteWebhook command
- [ ] Keep old code accessible
- [ ] Have polling mode config ready

## Known Issues Check

- Network: High (constant traffic)

### After (Webhook)
- API calls/minute: ~0-5 (only on updates)
- Response latency: 100ms - 200ms (direct delivery)
- CPU usage: ~1% (event-driven)
- Network: Low (update-based)

### Expected Improvements
- [ ] API calls reduced by >90%
- [ ] Response time improved by >50%
- [ ] CPU usage reduced by >70%
- [ ] Network traffic reduced by >90%
