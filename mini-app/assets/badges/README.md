# Badge Assets

This directory contains badge images for the gamification system.

## Alice Badge
- `alice-badge.png` - Badge icon for "Alice in Wonderland" achievement
- Should be a small circular icon (32x32px recommended)
- Used in both the Achievements page and Audio section

## Adding New Badges
1. Save badge images in this directory
2. Use descriptive filenames
3. Optimize images for web (compress, use appropriate format)
4. Reference in code using `/assets/badges/[filename]`
