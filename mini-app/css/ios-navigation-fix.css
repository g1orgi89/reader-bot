/**
 * 🍎 iOS Navigation Fix - DEPRECATED in Stage 1 Stabilization
 * 
 * STATUS: This file is being phased out as part of scroll architecture stabilization.
 * All rules have been integrated into:
 * - base.css (scroll container definition)
 * - scroll-fix.css (single scroll architecture)
 * - navigation.css (bottom nav behavior and keyboard handling)
 * 
 * STAGE 2: This file will be removed completely after verification.
 * For now, keeping it empty but loaded to prevent any dependent code from breaking.
 */

/* ============================================================================
   ALL RULES MOVED TO OTHER FILES
   ============================================================================ */

/* 🔧 Bottom navigation safe-area → navigation.css */
/* 🔧 Keyboard handling → navigation.css & scroll-fix.css */
/* 🔧 Scroll lock → scroll-fix.css */
/* 🔧 Page content padding → base.css (single source of truth) */

/* File intentionally left mostly empty - to be removed in Stage 2 */
