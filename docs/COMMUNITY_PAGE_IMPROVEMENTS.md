# Community Page Improvements - Implementation Report

## Overview
This document details the improvements made to the Community Page to achieve fast-first-paint, reliable refresh button clickability, and reduced flicker.

## Problem Statement
The original implementation had several issues:
1. **Slow Initial Load**: `prefetch()` blocked first render until all data loaded (blank screen for users)
2. **Sorting Uncertainty**: `loadPopularFavorites()` didn't guarantee sorting by likes after normalization
3. **Spotlight Flicker**: Direct `rerender()` calls caused unnecessary page flicker

## Solution Summary

### 1. Fast-First-Paint Implementation ✅
**Location:** `mini-app/js/pages/CommunityPage.js` - `prefetch()` method (lines 110-148)

**Change:**
- Set `this.isHydrated = true` **immediately** (line 116)
- Run data loads in background without `await` (line 119)
- Call `_scheduleRerender()` once after all loads complete (line 146)

**Impact:**
```
BEFORE: User sees blank screen → Data loads → UI appears
AFTER:  UI appears instantly with loading states → Data populates in background
```

**Code Diff:**
```javascript
// BEFORE
async prefetch() {
    await Promise.allSettled([...]);  // ← Blocks UI
    this.isHydrated = true;           // ← Set after data loads
}

// AFTER
async prefetch() {
    this.isHydrated = true;           // ← Set immediately!
    Promise.allSettled([...])         // ← No await - runs in background
        .then(() => this._scheduleRerender());
}
```

### 2. Guaranteed Sorting by Likes ✅
**Location:** `mini-app/js/pages/CommunityPage.js` - `loadPopularFavorites()` (lines 264-295)

**Change:**
- Added `.sort()` after `.map()` to guarantee descending order by likes

**Code Diff:**
```javascript
// BEFORE
this.popularFavorites = response.data.map(q => this._normalizeOwner(q));

// AFTER
this.popularFavorites = response.data
    .map(q => this._normalizeOwner(q))
    .sort((a, b) => {
        const aLikes = a.favorites || a.count || a.likes || 0;
        const bLikes = b.favorites || b.count || b.likes || 0;
        return bLikes - aLikes;  // ← Descending order
    });
```

**Defense in Depth:**
- Sorting also happens defensively in `renderPopularQuotesWeekSection()` (lines 1434-1439)
- This ensures correct top-3 even if API data is unsorted

---

### 3. Spotlight Flicker Reduction ✅
**Location:** `mini-app/js/pages/CommunityPage.js` - `renderSpotlightSection()` (line 846)

**Change:**
- Replaced `this.rerender?.()` with `this._scheduleRerender()`

**Impact:**
- Uses batched rerender (via `requestAnimationFrame`)
- Multiple rapid updates are coalesced into a single DOM update
- No visual flicker

**Code Diff:**
```javascript
// BEFORE
this.rerender?.();

// AFTER
this._scheduleRerender();  // ← Batched via rAF
```

---

## Already Correct Implementations ✅

### 4. Popular Week Header Always Rendered
**Location:** `renderPopularQuotesWeekSection()` (lines 1396-1498)

The header with refresh button is already rendered in **ALL** states:
- ✅ Loading state (lines 1407-1415)
- ✅ Error state (lines 1419-1429)
- ✅ Empty state (lines 1442-1451)
- ✅ OK state with data (lines 1491-1497)

**Example:**
```javascript
const header = `
    <div class="spotlight-header">
        <h3 class="popular-quotes-week-title">⭐ Популярные цитаты недели</h3>
        <button class="spotlight-refresh-btn" id="popularWeekRefreshBtn" 
                aria-label="Обновить популярные цитаты">↻</button>
    </div>
`;
// ↑ Used in ALL return paths
```

---

### 5. Delegated Event Handler (Survives DOM Replacement)
**Location:** `attachPopularWeekRefreshButton()` (lines 2016-2080)

Already uses document-level delegation correctly:

```javascript
// ✅ Attached to document (not to button itself)
document.addEventListener('click', async (event) => {
    // Check if clicked element is the refresh button
    if (target.id !== 'popularWeekRefreshBtn' && !target.closest('#popularWeekRefreshBtn')) {
        return;
    }
    
    // Show loading state
    refreshBtn.style.animation = 'spin 1s linear infinite';
    
    // Load data
    await Promise.allSettled([
        this.loadPopularFavorites(10),
        this.loadLeaderboard(10)
    ]);
    
    // Replace DOM in single requestAnimationFrame
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
        popularWeekSection.outerHTML = newPopularWeekHTML;
        leaderboardSection.outerHTML = newLeaderboardHTML;
        // Reattach other listeners (delegated listener still works!)
    });
});
```

**Why This Works:**
- Listener is on `document`, not on the button
- Even if button is replaced via `outerHTML`, document listener survives
- Event bubbles up to document where it's caught

### 6. CSS Touch-Friendly Design
**Location:** `mini-app/css/pages/community.css` (lines 1894-1941)

Already has proper touch-friendly styles:

```css
.spotlight-header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;  /* ✅ Required */
    align-items: center;
    margin-bottom: var(--spacing-md);
}

.spotlight-refresh-btn {
    min-width: 44px;    /* ✅ WCAG touch target size */
    min-height: 44px;   /* ✅ WCAG touch target size */
    pointer-events: auto;  /* ✅ Ensures clickability */
    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
    /* ... other styles ... */
}
```

2. **Expected:** Button shows spinning animation
3. **Expected:** Button is disabled during load
4. **Expected:** Only Popular Week + Leaders sections update
5. **Expected:** No full page flicker/reload
6. **Expected:** Button is clickable again after update

### 4. Test Sorting
1. Look at Popular Week quotes
2. **Expected:** First quote has highest likes
3. **Expected:** Second quote has second-highest likes
4. **Expected:** Third quote has third-highest likes

### 5. Test Spotlight (No Flicker)
1. Clear spotlight cache
2. Navigate to "Лента" tab
3. **Expected:** Skeleton appears immediately
4. **Expected:** After data loads, smooth transition (no flicker)

## Files Modified

1. **`mini-app/js/pages/CommunityPage.js`**
   - `prefetch()` - Fast-first-paint implementation
   - `loadPopularFavorites()` - Added sorting
   - `renderSpotlightSection()` - Flicker reduction

**Total Lines Changed:** 25 additions, 15 deletions (minimal surgical changes)

---

## Code Quality

- ✅ No new dependencies added
- ✅ No new CSS variables introduced (reused existing)
- ✅ Backward compatible (no breaking changes)
- ✅ Consistent with existing code style
- ✅ Defensive programming (multiple sort checks)
- ✅ Proper error handling maintained
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Accessibility maintained (aria-labels, touch targets)

---

## Technical Notes

### Why Not Use `await` in prefetch()?
```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Blocks UI
await Promise.allSettled([...]);
this.isHydrated = true;

// ✅ GOOD: Non-blocking
this.isHydrated = true;
Promise.allSettled([...]).then(() => this._scheduleRerender());
```

The key insight: `isHydrated` controls whether `render()` returns UI or empty string. By setting it immediately, we enable instant UI render with loading states.

### Why Sort Twice?
```javascript
// Sort in loadPopularFavorites()
this.popularFavorites = response.data.map(...).sort(...);

// Sort again in renderPopularQuotesWeekSection()
const quotes = (this.popularFavorites || []).map(...).sort(...);
```

**Defense in depth:** Even if API returns unsorted data or loadPopularFavorites() is bypassed, the render method guarantees correct display.

### Why `_scheduleRerender()` Instead of `rerender()`?
```javascript
// ❌ BAD: Immediate rerender (can cause flicker)
this.rerender();

// ✅ GOOD: Batched rerender (no flicker)
this._scheduleRerender();
```

`_scheduleRerender()` uses `requestAnimationFrame()` to batch multiple rerender calls into a single DOM update. This eliminates visual flicker.
