## Known Issues

### 1. Modal Overflow on iPad
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Modals may exceed viewport height on iPad and tall screens  
**Workaround:** Scroll within modal content  
**Fix Status:** Planned for next release (add `max-height: calc(100vh - var(--safe-area-bottom))` + `overflow-y: auto`)

### 2. iOS Safe Area Bottom Padding
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Bottom navigation may partially overlap home indicator on iPhone 14 Pro Max and newer  
**Workaround:** None (functional but suboptimal UX)  
**Fix Status:** Requires device-specific testing and refinement of `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`

### 3. Touch Target Sizes
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Some interactive elements < 44px (iOS accessibility guideline)  
**Workaround:** Users can still tap but may require precision  
**Fix Status:** Full audit in progress; fix planned for next release

### 4. Console Logs in Production
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Debug logs visible in browser console (no functional impact)  
**Workaround:** N/A  
**Fix Status:** Cleanup scheduled before public release
