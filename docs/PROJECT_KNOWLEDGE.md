# PROJECT KNOWLEDGE: Reader Bot Telegram Mini App

**Last Updated:** October 24, 2024  
**Status:** Development (Pre-Production)

---

## 🌐 Hosting & Production Details

### Live Environment
- **API Host:** [app.unibotz.com](https://app.unibotz.com) (backend API only, no public web UI)
- **Telegram Entry:** [https://t.me/reader_app_bot/Reader](https://t.me/reader_app_bot/Reader)
- **Hosting Provider:** Contabo VPS
- **Web Server:** Nginx reverse proxy
- **Process Manager:** PM2 (`pm2 start server/index.js --name reader-bot`)
- **Database:** MongoDB via Docker on VPS
- **Deployment:** SSH-based manual deployment

> **Important:** This is a **Telegram-only Mini App**. The domain app.unibotz.com serves as the API host behind Nginx/PM2. The user interface is only accessible via the Telegram Mini App, not by visiting the domain directly.

### Infrastructure Commands
```bash
# Start application
pm2 start server/index.js --name reader-bot

# Check status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs reader-bot

# Stop application
pm2 stop reader-bot
```

## 🏗 Architecture & Tech Stack

### Tech Stack

**Frontend (Telegram Mini App):**
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (no frameworks — explicit requirement)
- **JSDoc for type hints** (NO TypeScript)
- **CSS Variables** for theming (`mini-app/css/variables.css`)
- **Telegram Web App SDK** v6.0+
- **Service Worker** for offline support (basic implementation)

**Backend:**
- **Node.js 18+** with Express
- **MongoDB 7.0+** (Mongoose ODM)
- **Claude API (Anthropic)** or OpenAI for AI features
- **Telegraf** for Telegram Bot (webhook mode)

**DevOps:**
- **Webhook mode** (no long-polling bot)
- **Cron jobs** via `node-cron` for scheduled reports
- **Winston** for logging
- **Helmet + CORS** for security

### Key Files

**Mini App:**
- `mini-app/index.html` — Main HTML entry point
- `mini-app/js/core/App.js` — Application orchestrator
- `mini-app/js/core/Router.js` — Client-side routing
- `mini-app/js/core/State.js` — Global state management
- `mini-app/css/variables.css` — Design system (DO NOT MODIFY COLORS)

**Backend:**
- `server/index.js` — Express server + webhook setup
- `server/api/reader.js` — Main API routes
- `server/models/` — MongoDB schemas (User, Quote, Report, etc.)
- `server/services/` — Business logic (AI, reminders, statistics)

**Configuration:**
- `.env` — Environment variables (see `.env.example`)
- `package.json` — Dependencies & scripts

### Design Constraints

**CRITICAL: CSS Variable Locking**
The brand colors are **hardcoded and locked** in `mini-app/index.html`:

```css
--primary-color: #D2452C !important;  /* Terracotta */
--bg-primary: #F5F2EC;                /* Light beige */
--text-primary: #2C1810;              /* Dark brown */
```

**Do NOT:**
- Rename or remove existing CSS variables
- Add new color variables (reuse existing tokens)
- Override `--primary-color` in any CSS file

**JavaScript monitors** any attempt to change `--primary-color` and reverts it (see brand guard script in `index.html`).

## 🐛 Known Issues

### High Priority

1. **Modal Overflow on Tall Screens**  
   - Modals may exceed viewport height on iPad and notched iPhones
   - Needs `max-height` with internal scroll (`max-height: calc(100vh - var(--safe-area-bottom))` + `overflow-y: auto`)
   - Priority: Medium

2. **iOS Safe Area Bottom Padding**  
   - Bottom navigation may overlap home indicator on newer iPhones
   - Requires testing on iPhone 15 Pro Max and refinement of `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`
   - Priority: Medium

3. **Red Analysis Card Readability**  
   - Text contrast and line-height issues on "Analysis from Anna" cards
   - Needs improved line-height and contrast ratio adjustments
   - Priority: Low

4. **Touch Target Sizes**  
   - Some interactive elements are <44px (iOS guideline)
   - Full audit required to ensure all buttons/links meet ≥44px minimum
   - Priority: High

5. **Debug Logs in Production**  
   - Console logs not removed from some files
   - Need to strip all `console.log()` statements before release
   - Priority: High

## 📋 Deployment Notes

### Production Deployment Process
1. SSH into Contabo VPS
2. Navigate to app directory
3. Pull latest changes from repository
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Restart PM2 process: `pm2 restart reader-bot`
6. Monitor logs: `pm2 logs reader-bot`

### MongoDB Management
- MongoDB runs via Docker on the VPS
- Connection string configured in `.env` file
- Database backups should be configured separately

## 🧪 QA & Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Coverage

**Tested on:**
- iPhone 14 Pro (iOS 17.2) — Primary device
- Android Pixel 6 (Android 13) — Secondary
- Desktop Chrome 120 (with mock SDK)

**Not Tested:**
- iPhone SE (small screen)
- iPad Pro (tablet layout)
- Older Android versions (<12)

### Test Scenarios

**Critical Flows:**
1. ✅ Onboarding completion (7 questions → result page)
2. ✅ Quote creation with all fields filled
3. ✅ Quote creation with minimal fields (only text + book title)
4. ✅ Daily limit enforcement (11th quote blocked)
5. ✅ Weekly report display with recommendations
6. ✅ Book catalog browsing & click tracking
7. ✅ Community feed scrolling & favoriting
8. ✅ Dark mode theme switch

**Edge Cases:**
1. ⚠️ Quote with 1000+ characters (exceeds screen height)
2. ⚠️ Book title with special characters (emoji, Cyrillic)
3. ❌ Offline quote submission (not implemented)
4. ❌ Network timeout on report fetch (no retry logic)

### Automated Tests

**Backend:**
- Unit tests: `tests/*.test.js` (Jest)
- Coverage: ~60% (models + services)
- **Missing:** API integration tests with Supertest

**Frontend:**
- **No automated tests** (manual QA only)
- **Recommendation:** Add Playwright for E2E tests

## ❓ Questions for Maintainer

**Clarifications Needed:**

1. **Admin Panel Scope:**  
   - Should admin panel be migrated from Shrooms Bot codebase?
   - Or is this a separate project not included in this repository?

2. **Localization Strategy:**  
   - Plan to support English in the future?
   - If yes, should we start using i18n keys now?

3. **Offline Mode Priority:**  
   - Is IndexedDB queue for quotes a must-have for v1.0?
   - Or can this be deferred to v1.1?

4. **Analytics Platform:**  
   - Are we sending UTM data to Google Analytics / Mixpanel?
   - Or just storing in MongoDB for internal dashboards?

5. **Content Moderation:**  
   - Who moderates community quotes (Anna or automated AI filter)?
   - Should we add a "Report" button for inappropriate content?

6. **Promo Code System:**  
   - Are promo codes validated in this app or on external payment page?
   - Should we track redemption in MongoDB?
