# Before & After: Likes System Comparison

## User Experience Changes

### Scenario 1: Liking a Quote from Community

#### BEFORE ❌
1. User sees quote from another user in "Сейчас в сообществе"
2. User taps heart (♡)
3. **Problem**: Heart stays empty (♡) even after tap
4. **Side effect**: A NEW quote is created in user's diary with same text
5. **Ownership confusion**: Quote appears to be "added" to user's collection
6. User sees notification: "Добавлено в избранное!" (misleading)
7. On reload, heart is still empty because `likedByMe` wasn't implemented

**Issues:**
- ❌ Heart doesn't fill after like
- ❌ Creates duplicate quote in diary
- ❌ Confuses ownership (quote seems to become user's)
- ❌ Can't unlike once liked
- ❌ State not preserved on reload

#### AFTER ✅
1. User sees quote from another user in "Сейчас в сообществе"
2. User taps heart (♡)
3. **Fixed**: Heart immediately fills (❤) and counter increases
4. **No side effects**: No quote created in user's diary
5. **Clear ownership**: Quote owner remains original uploader
6. User sees notification: "Вы поставили лайк цитате!" (accurate)
7. On reload, heart stays filled because `likedByMe` is returned from API

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Heart fills immediately with optimistic UI
- ✅ No diary pollution
- ✅ Clear attribution to original creator
- ✅ Can tap again to unlike
- ✅ State persists across reloads

---

### Scenario 2: Unliking a Quote

#### BEFORE ❌
**Not possible!** Once you liked a quote, you couldn't unlike it.
- Early return prevented second tap: `if (button.classList.contains('favorited')) return;`
- User had to manually delete quote from diary to "unlike"

#### AFTER ✅
1. User sees filled heart (❤) on previously liked quote
2. User taps heart (❤)
3. Heart immediately empties (♡) and counter decreases
4. API call removes like from Favorites collection
5. User sees notification: "Лайк снят."
6. User can tap again to re-like if desired

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Full toggle functionality
- ✅ Immediate visual feedback
- ✅ Can like/unlike multiple times

---

### Scenario 3: Viewing Popular Quotes of the Week

#### BEFORE ❌
```javascript
// Owner was set to firstUserId (first liker) as fallback
const targetUserId = originUserId || pf.firstUserId;

// Problem: If origin user not found, first liker became "owner"
// This created confusion: "Why is my name on someone else's quote?"
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Quotes could appear to be "owned" by liker instead of creator
- ❌ Attribution was incorrect in some cases
- ❌ Hearts not initialized from backend data

#### AFTER ✅
```javascript
// Owner is ONLY origin user (earliest creator)
const user = originUserId ? userMap.get(String(originUserId)) : null;

// If no origin found, shows generic "Пользователь" instead of liker
// Hearts initialized from likedByMe field
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Strict origin attribution - quotes never "become mine"
- ✅ Honest fallback if origin unknown
- ✅ Hearts show correct initial state

---

### Scenario 4: Page Reload

#### BEFORE ❌
1. User liked 3 quotes (hearts filled)
2. User reloads page
3. **Problem**: All hearts reset to empty (♡)
4. **Counters correct** but visual state wrong
5. User confused about which quotes they liked

**Issue:**
- ❌ Hearts didn't reflect actual like state after reload
- ❌ `likedByMe` field didn't exist in API responses

#### AFTER ✅
1. User liked 3 quotes (hearts filled)
2. User reloads page
3. **Fixed**: Hearts remain filled (❤) for liked quotes
4. **Counters and state consistent**
5. User can immediately see their liked quotes

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Persistent visual state
- ✅ No confusion on reload
- ✅ `likedByMe` field in API responses

---

## Technical Comparison

### Backend API Responses

#### BEFORE ❌
```json
{
  "text": "Quote text",
  "author": "Author name",
  "favorites": 10,
  "user": {
    "userId": "67890",  // Could be liker, not creator!
    "name": "First Liker"
  }
}
```

#### AFTER ✅
```json
{
  "text": "Quote text",
  "author": "Author name", 
  "favorites": 10,
  "likedByMe": true,  // NEW! Shows if current user liked
  "user": {
    "userId": "12345",  // Always original creator
    "name": "Original Uploader"
  }
}
```

---

### Frontend Like Handler

#### BEFORE ❌ (Simplified)
```javascript
async addQuoteToFavorites(event) {
  // Early return prevented unlike
  if (button.classList.contains('favorited')) {
    return; // ❌ Can't unlike!
  }
  
  // Check if quote exists in user's diary
  const existingQuote = existingQuotes.find(...);
  
  if (existingQuote) {
    // ❌ Updates diary quote
    await this.api.request('PUT', `/quotes/${existingQuote.id}`, {
      isFavorite: true
    });
  }
  
  // Then adds community like
  await this.api.likeQuote({ text, author });
  
  // ❌ Heart doesn't fill
  // ❌ Creates diary pollution
}
```

#### AFTER ✅ (Simplified)
```javascript
async addQuoteToFavorites(event) {
  // Detect current state
  const wasFavorited = button.classList.contains('favorited');
  
  if (wasFavorited) {
    // UNLIKE flow
    button.innerHTML = '♡';
    button.classList.remove('favorited');
    await this.api.unlikeQuote({ text, author });
    this.showNotification('Лайк снят.', 'info');
  } else {
    // LIKE flow
    button.innerHTML = '❤';
    button.classList.add('favorited');
    await this.api.likeQuote({ text, author });
    this.showNotification('Вы поставили лайк цитате!', 'success');
  }
  
  // ✅ Full toggle support
  // ✅ No diary side effects
  // ✅ Hearts fill/unfill correctly
}
```

---

### Heart Rendering

#### BEFORE ❌
```javascript
// Hearts always rendered empty
<button class="quote-card__heart-btn">♡</button>
```

#### AFTER ✅
```javascript
// Hearts render based on likedByMe from API
<button class="quote-card__heart-btn${item.likedByMe ? ' favorited' : ''}">
  ${item.likedByMe ? '❤' : '♡'}
</button>
```
